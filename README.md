Rss-feed
Project Description ðŸ“¢
This project aims to develop an RSS feed aggregator using Django. The aggregator will extract and store data from various RSS feed sources, including APIs and custom XML feeds. It will implement advanced parsing techniques, data mapping, and flexible schema design to accommodate diverse feed structures. The project will also include custom JWT authentication using Redis to store access tokens and utilize and PostgreSQL as the database.

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

ðŸ‘‰ Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Farzadkamyab/RssReader.git
ðŸ‘‰ Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
ðŸ‘‰ Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS and Linux:

source venv/bin/activate
ðŸ‘‰ Install project dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
ðŸ‘‰ Run migrations to create the database schema:

python manage.py migrate
ðŸ‘‰ Start the Django development server:

python manage.py runserver
The project should now be running locally at http://localhost:8000/.âœ…

ðŸŒŸ Parse Podcasts
To parse the podcast feeds and populate your database with podcast episodes, you can use the following management command:
